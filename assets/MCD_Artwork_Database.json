    "Description":"Description\/brief of the exhibit",
    "Information":"Buttons are usually viewed as an everyday object serving the routine purpose of fastening one clothes. But creative artist Beau McCall, through his wearable and visual artwork, inspires us to see buttons anew. In his hands, buttons are transformed into dazzing maximalist fashion statements and awe-inspiring sculptural objects.\nButtons small, numble, and rendered virtually invisible - become giant, powerful, and visually arresting when MeCall transforms them with his unique artistic vision.\nHe reveals the limitless potential of the button to captivate, provoke, inspire, and to tell stories of joy, strength, and beauty.\nButtons On! marks the first ever retrospective for McCall. Proclaimed by American Creft magazine as the \"Button Man,\" McCall creates wearable and visual art by hand-sewing clothing buttons onto mostly upcycled fabrics, materials, and abjects. Buttons On! showcases pieces from MeCall's nearly forty-year career, the debut of several new works, and select archival material. Organized into several themes, the exhibition explores McCalls mastery of the button and offers commentary on topics such as pop culture and social justice.\nThe exhibition's four themes each represent a different facet of McCall's creative practice They include: \"Buttons on the Boy,\" an exploration of nearly forty-years of button embellished wearable art, \"Buttons on the Mind,\" a survey of over ten years of visual create using buttons as the primary medium; \"Buttons on the Soul,\" a collection of archival materials documenting McCall's career and evolution; and\n'Buttons Off,\" a selection of items from McCall's forays into buttonless wearable and visualart.\nNow, nearly four decades since his professional debut, McCall is receiving the recogrition he deserves for his cultural contributions and command of the button in art. This retrospective aims to amplify McCall's legacy as an artist whose works are among the mast original and innovative of our time.  A fun fact about McCall's work is that his signature is two fish buttons, because he's a pisces! May this exhibition inspire you to put your buttons on!"

    "Information":"2022\nAssorted buttons (cloth, rhinestone, plastic, et al.), embroidery thread, upcycled Adidas nylon and rubber sneakers\nSneakers and pop culture frequently influence one another. For example, the classic song My Adidas by Run-DMC was inspired by the sneaker brand and simultaneously helped increase Adidas's mass appeal. Furthermore, works by artists such as Andy Warhol have been adapted into sneaker brand collaborations. In this series, McCall contributes to this long-standing relationship between sneakers and pop culture. He upcycles Run-DMC-inspired Adidas to create work that celebrate mass culture.\nMoonwalk tributes recording artist Michael Jackson's popularization of the moonwalk dance. Sole Power II was inspired by the film Black Panther and its fictional city of Wakanda. All Sports draws a direct connection between sneakers and athletics where they are ubiquitous both for their functionality and aesthetics.\nSunny are of special importance as they also represent a recurring theme within McCall's work: joy. In several of his works, McCall includes yellow smiley face buttons. This popular ideogram and communication tool (e.g. emotions) represents joy worldwide.\nHere McCall places a smitey button on top of a saturation of mostly yellow buttons to evoke feelings of fun and whimsy."

Along with McCall they formed a punk rock band named Strange Beauties.\nThe short-lived band (circa 1983-1986) created an important outlet for their creative expression and exploration of sexuality and gender-nonconforming identities.\nIn this collage, McCall reimagines one of the band's promotional photos. The eclectic choice of buttons, yellow highlighter, and striking lines across the band's countenances creates a punk rock aesthetic that is both edgy and glamorous. Each collage is created by hand using McCall's personal archival photos and papers, along with images from his button-embellished artwork.\nOnce completed the works are then scanned and printed on metal for luminosity. Additional collages in this series (included in McCall's\ndebut artists' book which you may peruse in the gallery) include eight of his other close friends. Collectively, the images capture the late 1970s to the mid-1990s, from Philadelphia to New York, during the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the height of disco music, and the AIDS crisis. Through this intimate series McCall represents the experiences, hopes, challenges, and heart of the LGBTQ+ community.\nPlease scan QR code to watch McCall discuss this series and to listen to the Strange Beauties demo recordings."

    "Information":"2012\nPlastic buttons, glow-in-the-dark embroidery thread, denim, burlap, plexiglass\nMcCall reimagines the U.S. flag using four crowns and the colors of the Pan- African flag: red, black, and green. Since its adoption by Marcus Garvey's United Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in 1920, the flag has represented Black freedom and unity. Thus, McCall transforms the American flag into a symbol of the perseverance of Black people seeking freedom and social justice throughout the African diaspora.\nThe title is from the 1973 self-titled album by Elaine Brown (the hrst and only female leader of the Black Panther Party). With this work, McCall joins a chorus of artists who have used the Pan-African flag colors in their work(s) and\/or been inspired by the Black Panther Party such as David Hammons and Black Panther Party members Emory Douglas and Dorothy E. Hayes.\nThis was the hrst visual art piece McCall debuted after returning from his professional hiatus in 2012."

    "Information":"2016\nPolywood and plastic buttons, embroidery thread, cotton fabric, wood chair, rulers, yardsticks\nABCDEFU is informed by the traumatic physical and mental abuse, and racism, experienced by McCall and numerous students in Catholic school during the 1960s. The crosshair represents being a target of abuse by nuns. It is comprised of rulers and yardsticks which the nuns used to beat students. These items are adorned with buttons spelling out phrases such as \"Yes, sister,\" and \"No, sister.\" The school chair is the site of pain, reflection, healing, and holy revenge as McCall gives a middle finger to the Catholic school system using buttons spelling out \"FU.\" Adding levity, McCall arranges pink buttons into wads of chewing gum under the chair and desk.\nBack then, McCall was able to get some immediate revenge when a nun punched him and he courageously hit her back. But mostly during this challenging time, McCall's refuge was in creating art and here he once again demonstrates craft's cathartic power."

    "Information":"2014\nAssorted buttons (mother-of-pearl, rhinestone, cloth, et al.), embroidery thread, cotton fabric, cast iron tub. Commissioned by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.\nIn the creation of this work, McCall was inspired by the poem one from Ntozake Shange's choreopoem, for colored girls who have considered suicide \/ when the rainbow is enuf. He depicts the climax of the poem when lady in red, after giving herself to a lover\n-and cycling through emotions of possible regret or ambivalence-prepares a bath to wash away his scent and the glittering elements she uses to adorn her body. Thereby, McCall's imagining of this bathtub becomes a spiritual and ritualistic sanctuary and site of one's search for inner peace and self-love. He takes an everyday object and elevates it with his own commentary\nMcCall's intentionality in the buttons he selects for each work is brilliantly manifested here through buttons of iridescent, shimmering, and vibrant hues that elevate the work with visual splendor. The poetic approach to the source material's theme combined with skillful artistry place it in conversation with other artworks inspired by the work of writers such as Sir John Everett Millais's Ophelia (1851-1852) inspired by Shakespeare's Hamlet, and Salvador Dali's Mad Tea Party (1969) inspired by Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland.\nScan the QR code to read one from Ntozake Shange's for colored girls..."

    "Information":"1982\nPlastic buttons, embroidery thread, safety pins, upcycled wool sweater\nThis sweater is the earliest example of McCall's button-embellished wearable art. Thus, it illustrates key differences between his earlier and more advanced technique.\nThe Arst noticeable difference is the use of wool, unlike later works that primarily use upcycled denim. The switch in fabrics came after McCall learned that the wool knit material could not sustain the weight of an abundance of buttons. Secondly, unlike his later works, the buttons here are not sewn in a continuous thread pattern. Instead, the thread is cut off with the placement of each button. Finally, there Is a less layered fashion than McCall's later works, Here, the buttons are sewn onto the garment without a base layer of buttons ta conceal the original fabric.\nThis was Beau's first wearable piece, with a fun story about how he went to the club wearing it and at the end of the day the sweater was down to his knees given all the weight!\nWhat remains similar between this object and later works is McCall's mostly maximalist approach to button embellishment. Do you notice any other signiticant differences and\/or similarities?"

    "Information":"2013\nPlastic buttons, embroidery thread, wood shelf, doilies, plastic jar, plexiglass\nThis work is part of McCall's \"Hood Classic\" series which finds him subverting the negative connotations attached with labeling items as \"hood.\" Yet, in this work he not only celebrates, but also calls into question the role such items play within our culture.\nFor McCall, Kool-Aid was a popular drink growing up in the \"hood.\" It simultaneously recalls the joys of youth while being a sugary unhealthy choice of beverage that was mostly targeted to economically disadvantaged families.\nMcCall captures the duality of this popular drink through his choice of two buttons for the Kool-Aid Man's eyes: a skeleton head (left) and a smiley face (right). Like some of the best pop art this work makes us simultaneously revere and question the mass culture products we (literally) consume.\nWhat does Kool-Aid mean to you?"

    "Information":"early 1990s\nPlastic buttons, embroidery thread, upcycled Gazelle swim briefs\nWith these button speedos, McCall playfully draws connections between buttons and sexuality. The word \"button\" has been used colloquially to reference a clitoris and breasts and one of the meanings behind the idiom \"pushing someone's buttons\" is to arouse someone's sexual interest.\nHere, McCall was specifically inspired by the male strippers of the 1980s, whose costumes became more creative and provocative than in the mid-to-late 1970s when male stripping first started to become popular. McCall's spin features his signature stacking technique with buttons cleverly arranged to emphasize one's bulge. Do these pieces push your buttons (wink-wink)?"

Thus, McCall attempts to subvert the negative connotations attached with labeling these terms as \"hood.\" he offers a more balanced perspective as he celebrates -- and at times call into question -- the role they play within our culture. \nThe durags within this series exhibit the beauty of Black natural hair and demonstrates an appreciation for durags -- used in the maintenance of Black hair and to accessorize one's outfit. Gaining increased popularity in the 19970s and exploding into the pop-culture through hip-hop during the 1990s and 2000s, the durag has been both criminalzed and popularized within the mainstream. "

    "Information":"Assorted buttons (glass, wood, rhinestone, metal, ceramic, et. al) embroidery thread, ypcycled Levi's denim jacket \n\nSince the late 1990s McCall has created wearable art using upcycled denim, a durable and sustainable material that also has important links to the Black experience in America. These connections include the production of indigo to create the shortly denim uniform worn by the enslaved plantations, and the history of repurposing design. McCall's button works on denim pay tribute to this tradition of reclaimation and upcycling. \n\nBorn in Philly, Made in Harlem is the earliest example of McCall's use of denim. It is also the earliest example of the fine-tuned creative process with buttons in both his wearable and visual art. He begins by cutting the denim (if necessary) into a specific silhouette. Then, he sews a base layer of buttons onto the fabric. This foundation is usually of a uniform material and color the create a solid sheet or canvas. Simultaneously, while constructing the base layer, McCall views decorative buttons to convey the story, message, mood, or emotion the wishes to impart. \n\nMcCall chooses to work with denim not just because of its durability (each jacket can be 20-40lbs) , but also as an act of reclamation and elevation -- drawing on the history of many enslaved forced to wear denim as a strong fabric during indigo\/cotton slavery. \n\nHere, the message is pride as McCall celebrates his hometown of Philadelphia, PA (e.g. a pretzel shaped button regerencing this Philly food stand)."
